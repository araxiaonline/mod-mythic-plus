# Mythic Plus Module for AzerothCore

ðŸš¨ **This is not mythic like in retail.** ðŸš¨

This module started with the intention of creating a retail-like mythic plus system but has evolved into something unique. Instead, think of it as an **expansion of existing Wrath to new end game conte r** that reuses much of the existing dungeons and creatures, overhauling them to much higher difficulties with new loot mechanics.

## Overview

The Mythic Plus module transforms existing World of Warcraft dungeons (Wrath of the Lich King to add additional endgame content) into challenging, scaled encounters with progressive difficulty levels, enhanced rewards, and unique gameplay mechanics to extend gameplay experience.

## Features

### Core Systems
- **Progressive Difficulty Scaling**: Multiple tiers of difficulty that scale creature stats, abilities, and rewards  
- **Player Advancement System**: Custom advancements for mythic plus progression, completion times, and special challenges
- **Voiced NPCs**: Enhanced immersion with voice acting for key NPCs and encounters
- **Dynamic Loot System**: New loot mechanics with scaled rewards based on difficulty completed
